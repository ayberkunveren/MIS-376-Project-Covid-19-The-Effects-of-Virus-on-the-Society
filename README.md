## *Step A: Problem Description*

Corona virus, which first came to Turkey on March 10, 2020, seriously damaged major sectors in the country. These are: health, economy, employment, tourism etc. However, on the basis of all of them, the damage to the economy both to the world and to our country has actually been the main reason for other sectors to be interrupted. For example, the economic downturn has caused many companies to fire their employees, take unpaid leaves or make various cuts.

The biggest repercussions of the economic problems were felt by smaller investors who trying to run their own business. Among these: cafe, restaurant, pub, game room owners can be considered. The main reason why the smaller businesses of the type I mentioned are so affected is that the customer must be physically present and the expenditure must be direct. However, the fact that such places had to be closed in line with the measures taken during the pandemic process affected them much more negatively in terms of business.

## *The Story of Economic Problem:*

Before moving on to my own study, I would like to share with you a part of the article published in January 2020 that examines the effects of the pandemic. The data in the quote you see has helped me gain some insight into the very serious effects of the economy during the pandemic process on the world.

***“The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown. There have been instances of price gouging. There have been widespread reports of shortages of pharmaceuticals, with many areas seeing panic buying and consequent shortages of food and other essential grocery items. Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020 that by the end of 2020, a total of 265 million people could starve. The technology industry, in particular, has been warning about delays to shipments of electronic goods. By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis. Global stock markets crashed in March 2020, with falls of several percent in the world's major indices. As the pandemic spreads, global conferences and events across technology, fashion, and sports are being cancelled or postponed while the monetary impact on the travel and trade industry is yet to be estimated, it is likely to be in the billions and increasing.” (https://www.globusjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GMIT-JJ20-Sakshi-Srivastava.pdf)***
    
I would like to explain what I will do in my own work after these serious results we have seen. In my study, I will try to explain with an example from my relative. How small business owners are affected by the economic situation during the pandemic process, what kind of support the government provides to these businesses, and what kind of results the business owners have to struggle with.

## *Step B: Information About Data*

## *The Visualization Tool:*

I prefer to use “Visme” site. I prefer that tool because it is easy to use and also free tool. 

## *Data Gathering and Challenges*

In data gathering process I will use some researchs from world and Turkey. I have faced with some problems because the economic problems also includes some political issues. I thought that I can use statistical institution datas but their last data sharing was from 2008. That is why I have to use the up-to-date researchs or articles to find datas.
